    I'm Nick, a CISSP certified Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professional. This site is where I'll be sharing my insights as I focus on my new career direction. My approach is grounded in a 'Defence in Depth' philosophy, combining robust policy with effective technical controls and, most importantly, well-trained people.

### Core Areas of Expertise
- **Security Awareness & Training Programs**  My specialty. I design and build engaging training programs from the ground up, often using Learning Management Systems (LMS), to create a resilient, security aware culture.
- **ISO 27001 Readiness & Audit Support**  Assisting organisations in preparing for ISO 27001 certification by reviewing controls, gathering evidence, and identifying gaps in the ISMS.
- **IT Policy & Governance**  Authoring and reviewing the clear, concise policies and procedures that form the bedrock of good governance and compliance.
- **Information Security Risk Management**  Conducting practical risk assessments to help organisations make smart, business-aligned security decisions.

### My Unique Background
My journey into GRC is built on 18 years of practical leadership and technical experience. I've managed networks, led teams, and successfully guided an organisation through its Cyber Essentials certification. My extensive career in education provides a rare ability to distill highly complex technical concepts into clear, actionable language for any audience. I am currently deepening this expertise through a Master's degree in Computer Science.
