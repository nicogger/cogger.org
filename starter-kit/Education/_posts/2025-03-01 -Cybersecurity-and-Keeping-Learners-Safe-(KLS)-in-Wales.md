# Cybersecurity and Keeping Learners Safe (KLS) in Wales

Safeguarding learners in Wales goes beyond physical safety‚Äîit extends into the digital world. The **Keeping Learners Safe (KLS)** framework outlines the statutory responsibilities of schools to create a safe and secure online environment for students. In an age where cyber threats, online risks, and data security are growing concerns, schools must align their IT and cybersecurity measures with **KLS** to protect learners effectively [1].

This post explores how schools in Wales can meet their cybersecurity obligations under KLS, how it compares to England‚Äôs **KCSIE (Keeping Children Safe in Education)** framework, and how aligning with cybersecurity best practices like **Cyber Essentials, Cyber First Schools, and ISO 27001** can enhance protection.

# 1. Cybersecurity and KLS: Key Requirements

KLS mandates that schools have **clear policies, robust digital safeguards, and effective monitoring** to ensure online safety. Schools must:

- Implement **web filtering and monitoring** to protect students from harmful online content [2].
- Establish **incident response procedures** for cyber threats [3].
- Ensure **data protection compliance** under UK GDPR when handling student and staff data [4].
- Maintain **strong governance and oversight**, with governing bodies taking responsibility for cybersecurity [3].

## Web Filtering and Monitoring
Under KLS, schools must deploy **real-time filtering** to block harmful websites while ensuring **age-appropriate internet access** [2]. Unlike a one-size-fits-all approach, filtering must be flexible enough to allow safe research and learning while preventing access to inappropriate material.

## Secure BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policies
With the growing use of personal devices in schools, KLS requires robust **BYOD policies** to manage security risks [4]. Schools must:
- Restrict access to sensitive data on personal devices.
- Use **network segmentation** to isolate BYOD devices from critical school infrastructure.
- Ensure **staff and students follow Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs)** for personal devices.

## Data Protection and Cyber Resilience
Schools are responsible for protecting sensitive data, including **student records, safeguarding reports, and exam results** [3]. To comply with KLS:
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for staff access.
- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- Maintain **regular backups** and test restoration processes [3].

# 2. Comparison: KLS (Wales) vs. KCSIE (England)

While both **KLS (Wales) and KCSIE (England)** focus on safeguarding, there are notable differences in their approach to cybersecurity:

| **Aspect**              | **KLS (Wales)** | **KCSIE (England)** |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Web Filtering & Monitoring | Must be **age-appropriate** and **reviewed regularly** [2]. | Schools must ensure **‚Äúappropriate filtering and monitoring‚Äù** but have more flexibility [5]. |
| Cybersecurity Governance | Governing bodies must **oversee cybersecurity risks** and ensure compliance [3]. | SLT and DSL (Designated Safeguarding Lead) typically handle cyber policies [5]. |
| BYOD & Device Security | Requires **strict policies and network separation** for personal devices [4]. | Schools must **consider** BYOD risks but policies vary per institution [6]. |
| Incident Response | Schools must have **formal cyber incident response plans** [3]. | Schools **should** report cyber incidents but response plans are not mandatory [7]. |

KLS provides **more structured guidance** on cybersecurity, ensuring Welsh schools have **clearer accountability and safeguards** in place compared to KCSIE.

# 3. How Schools Can Meet KLS Cybersecurity Expectations

## Implementing Strong Access Controls & Monitoring
- Deploy **firewalls, endpoint protection, and intrusion detection systems**.
- Ensure **monitoring tools** flag suspicious behavior for safeguarding staff [2].
- Use **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** for school-owned devices [8].

## Aligning Cybersecurity Policies with Safeguarding
- Develop **clear Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs)** that include cybersecurity expectations [4].
- Train **staff and students** on digital safety and responsible internet use [3].
- Conduct **annual risk assessments** of IT systems and policies [9].

## Staff and Learner Training in Digital Resilience
- Provide **regular cybersecurity training** for teachers and IT teams [3].
- Educate students about **phishing, scams, and AI-generated risks** [10].
- Ensure SLT and governors understand their **cybersecurity responsibilities** [3].

# 4. Going Beyond Compliance: Aligning with Cyber Best Practices

## Cyber Essentials (UK Government-backed certification)
‚úÖ Covers **basic security controls** to prevent cyberattacks.  
‚úÖ Aligns with KLS by ensuring **strong password policies and secure network access**.  

## Cyber First Schools (NCSC Initiative)
‚úÖ Encourages **cybersecurity education** alongside compliance.  
‚úÖ Helps students develop **practical cyber resilience skills** [3].  

## ISO 27001 (International Information Security Standard)
‚úÖ Provides a **structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks**.  
‚úÖ Ensures **compliance with GDPR, safeguarding policies, and KLS security expectations**.  

# Conclusion & Next Steps

Keeping learners safe online is a **shared responsibility** between IT teams, SLT, and safeguarding staff. Welsh schools should:
- **Review and update cybersecurity policies annually**.
- **Align web filtering and monitoring** with KLS expectations.
- **Train staff and learners** in digital safety and resilience.
- **Consider Cyber Essentials or ISO 27001** to go beyond compliance.
