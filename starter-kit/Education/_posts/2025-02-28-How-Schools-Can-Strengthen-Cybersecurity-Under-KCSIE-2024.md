# **How Schools Can Strengthen Cybersecurity Under KCSIE 2024**

Cybersecurity in schools has never been more important. With **Keeping Children Safe in Education (KCSIE) 2024** placing a strong emphasis on digital safeguarding, schools need to ensure their IT systems, policies, and training are up to the task. But what does that actually look like in practice? And how can schools strike a balance between security and usability?

Let’s break it down and explore what schools need to do—and how they can go beyond compliance to create a genuinely safe and effective digital learning environment.



## **Understanding the Risks**

The online world is full of opportunities, but it also presents a range of risks that schools need to manage. KCSIE highlights four key areas of concern:

- **Content** – Exposure to harmful material (such as extremist content, pornography, or misinformation).
- **Contact** – The risk of online grooming, cyberbullying, or exploitation.
- **Conduct** – Issues like oversharing personal information, engaging in cyberbullying, or attempting to bypass security controls.
- **Commerce** – Scams, phishing attacks, and financial fraud that could affect staff and students alike.

**Action Point:** Schools should ensure their **filtering and monitoring solutions** address all these risk categories and provide age-appropriate protection.



## **Filtering & Monitoring: Striking the Right Balance**

One of the key cybersecurity requirements under KCSIE is that schools have **appropriate filtering and monitoring systems** in place. But what does ‘appropriate’ actually mean?

### **Things to Consider:**

- **Too strict, and you risk blocking useful educational content.**
- **Too lenient, and students could be exposed to harmful material.**
- **Filtering should be age-appropriate, adaptable, and regularly reviewed.**

### **Best Practices:**

- Use a filtering provider that blocks **illegal and harmful content** (look for providers using Internet Watch Foundation and Counter-Terrorism blocklists).
- Ensure monitoring systems are in place—but also that staff know **how to interpret alerts and respond appropriately**.
- Regularly review filtering and monitoring settings to make sure they still meet the needs of students and staff.

## **Cybersecurity Beyond Compliance**

While KCSIE outlines the legal minimum schools must do, there are **other frameworks and certifications** that can help schools strengthen their cybersecurity.

- **Cyber Essentials** – A UK government-backed certification that covers the basics of cybersecurity, helping schools protect against common cyber threats.
- **ISO 27001** – A more advanced approach to information security management, often used by organisations handling large amounts of sensitive data.
- **Cyber First Schools** – A scheme designed to promote cybersecurity education, helping students develop the skills to stay safe online.

## **Remote Learning & BYOD: Managing Security Beyond the Classroom**

Many schools now allow **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** policies and remote learning, which raises some interesting security questions:

- How do you make sure personal devices connecting to the school network aren’t a security risk?
- What safeguards should be in place for students learning from home?
- Should filtering and monitoring extend to remote learning environments?

Some schools have opted for **Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions**, while others ensure **separate guest networks for BYOD devices**. There’s no single right answer—but it’s important to have **a clear policy** that staff, students, and parents understand.

## **Preparing for the Unexpected: Incident Response in Schools**

Cyber incidents can happen, even with the best precautions in place. The key is being **prepared to respond quickly and effectively**.

### **What Schools Should Have in Place:**

- A clear **incident response plan** outlining what to do in case of a cyberattack or data breach.
- Regular cybersecurity training so staff know how to spot phishing attempts and other threats.
- A **risk register** that tracks potential cybersecurity risks and how they’re being mitigated.

*Do you feel your school is prepared for a cyber incident? Or is this an area that still needs improvement?*

## **Final Thoughts**

Cybersecurity is an ongoing challenge, but it’s also an opportunity—an opportunity to **create a culture of online safety and digital responsibility** that benefits both students and staff.

KCSIE sets the foundation, but schools that go beyond the basics and adopt best practices like **Cyber Essentials or ISO 27001** will be in a much stronger position to handle today’s cybersecurity challenges.
